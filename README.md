# Hypothesis-Analysis-on-Nigerian-Youth-Smoking-Addiction

## Overview

This Project tests the hypothesis that "Over 5 million Nigerian youths are addicted to cigarette smoking". This analysis focus is on hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and visualizations of the results. The following sections summaize the work done during this session.

## Introduction

In this session, we explored various statistical analyses to assess whether over 5 million Nigerian youths are addicted to cigarette smoking. Key tasks included performing hypothesis testing, calculating confidence intervals, and visualizing the results to gain insights into the smoking behavior among Nigerian youths.

## Hypothesis Testing

We conducted a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of smokers in the sample supports the claim that there are over 5 million addicted youths in Nigeria. The analysis included:
- **Z-Statistic Calculation:** To assess the significance of the observed proportion.
- **P-Value:** To evaluate the probability of obtaining the observed results under the null hypothesis.

### Results:
- **Z-Statistic:** 10.52
- **P-Value:** 0.000000
- **Confidence Interval for Number of Smokers:**
  - **Lower Bound:** 18,407,509
  - **Upper Bound:** 24,545,847

## Visualizations

Visualizations were created to illustrate:
- **Confindence Interval:** Shows the range within which the true proportion of smokers is expected to fall.
- **Z-Statistic and P-Value:** Displays the significance of hypothesis test results.

## Conclusion

Given that the lower bound of the confidence interval for the number of smokers (18,407,509) is significantly higher than 5 million, we can confidently conclude that the claim that over 5 million Nigerian youth are addicted to cigarette smoking is supported by the data. In fact, the data suggests that the number of youth smokers is far higher than 5 million.

Therefore, the null hypothesis that the proportion of smokers is not greater than 5 million will be rejected. instead the Alternative hypothesis that the proportion of smokers is indeed greater than 5 million will be accepted.
